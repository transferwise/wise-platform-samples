# Wise Platform samples

Code samples to get started with common Wise API use cases.

Each sample includes server and client side code (powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)).
All calls to Wise API are done on the server side.

Start by picking a sample and look into `pages/index.tsx` (landing page).
